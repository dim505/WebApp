# WebApp
This repository will serve as a central point of all the projects I've done with more to come. I've experimented with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript  and JQuery in designing this website. 

Please see my portfolio live at (http://dmitriyprogrammingportfolio.tk/). It is automatically redeployed via a CI/CD pipeline to Azure with every commit to Github. 
At the moment I have 2 web based calculators, a link to my desktop application, and a link to my React JS Webstore.

Main_Portfolio Folder:  
C# Calculator:
This server side calculator is written in C#,HTML and CSS. All the calculations are done on the server. The framework that powers this calculator is ASP.NET Core Razor Pages. Please click here and here for the source code!(https://github.com/dim505/WebApp/blob/master/main_portfolio/Pages/Calculator.cshtml) and (https://github.com/dim505/WebApp/blob/master/main_portfolio/Pages/Calculator.cshtml.cs)

JavaScript Calculator:
This is written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with elements of JQuery and Popper JS. This is a client-side calculator that is draggable. It also remembers the drag location even after a page refresh. All calculations are done on the client's browser. (https://github.com/dim505/WebApp/blob/master/main_portfolio/Pages/JavaScriptCalc.cshtml)
