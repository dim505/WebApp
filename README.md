# WebApp
In this repository, I will be experimenting with ASP.Net Core. 



This website (http://dmitriyprogrammingportfolio.tk/) will act as a precursor to more advanced web applications. At the moment I have 2 web based calculators and a link to my desktop application.

Please see my website live. It is automatically redeployed via a CI/CD pipeline to Azure with every commit to Github.

C# Calculator:
This server side calculator is written in C#,HTML and CSS. All the calculations are done on the server. The framework that powers this calculator is ASP.NET Core Razor Pages. Please click here and here for the source code!(https://github.com/dim505/WebApp/blob/master/Pages/Calculator.cshtml) and (https://github.com/dim505/WebApp/blob/master/Pages/Calculator.cshtml.cs)

JavaScript Calculator:
This is written in Javascript, HTML, and CSS with elements of JQuery and Popper JS. This is a client-side calculator that is draggable. It also remembers the drag location even after a page refresh. All calculations are done on the client's browser. (https://github.com/dim505/WebApp/blob/master/Pages/JavaScriptCalc.cshtml)
